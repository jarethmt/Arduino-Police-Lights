## Arduino Police Lights ##

A fun little project to turn your Arduino and a Neopixel strip into your very own police lightbar. Features three flash patterns on a loop, and is programmed to be wired to Pin2 on a 30 LED strip. You can modify the variables at the top to change the pin and LED count, and if you modify the code in the loop, you can change the flash patterns to remove some, reorder them, or time them differently. The arguments for each flash pattern function is the number of times it should run before moving to the next pattern.
